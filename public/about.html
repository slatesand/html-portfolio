<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from San Diego State University in 2020 with a BS Finance. My career began at Calpine Energy Solutions, where I helped drive consumer growth from 100,000 to 5 million meters. I specialized in assisting new municipalites with onboarding and implementing our services. After four years at Calpine, I shifted my focus back to finance and started a position as a Revenue Analyst II at Intuit. I helped maintain and modify a QuickBooks Reseller commission program, paying out $20M+ in commissions annually. I am currently working in an AR & Revenue Analyst role at an innovative Blockchain company. </p>

<p>I aspire to enhance my web development and software engineering skills to enhance my current career in the web3 space. My goals include developing comprehensive quantitative financial models, deploying smart contracts, and automating revenue generation processes.</p>

<p>Personally, I aim to develop a website that models prospect performance for Anaheim Ducks and San Diego Padres players. This model will track current performance and predict future outcomes by utilizing past player performance and weighting by league.</p>

<p>I would also like to develop a resource that enhances language learning skills, specifically Italian, to enable my own learning.</p>
